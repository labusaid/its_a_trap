We have noticed that the distribution of speeds looks much like a gamma distribution when corrected by the speed limit.
A potential explanation is that the incidence of police stops increases with polynomial growth, while the incidence of a certain speed occuring decays expoinentially.

This causes an initial growth 

```{r}
RiskCdf = ecdf(riskFactors)
a=10.5
b=1.5
gammaDest = function(x) 1/(gamma(a)*b^a)*x^(a-1)*exp(-x/b)
xaxis = seq(0,100,0.05)
p = ggplot() + geom_line(aes(x=xaxis, y=gammaDest(xaxis), colour = "gamma")) +
  geom_density(aes(x=speedingDfNoNA$Alleged_Speed-speedingDfNoNA$Posted_Speed, colour = "speed over limit (m.p.h.)")) + scale_fill_discrete(name = "Density", labels = "colour")
plot(p)
```
